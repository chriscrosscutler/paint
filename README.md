# paint
We included a paper.js library that included all the functions we need to turn the page into a paint canvas. 
We included CSS to style the legend at the bottom of the page and JavaScript to change behavior.

We had trouble animating the path and the color. The paper.js app included a Color object that contains RGB as
well as HSV values so we could cycle through hues.
